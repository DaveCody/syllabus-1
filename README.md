* **Instructor Office Hours:** Thursdays, 1:00pm - 3:00pm or [by appointment](mailto:charles.lang@nyu.edu)
*  **Prerequisite:** HUDK 4050

## Course Description

This course is a design studio-style course teaching how to distill and engineer features for data mining. Students will cover a workflow process for feature engineering and distillation; including brainstorming features, deciding what features to create, visualization, and criteria for selecting features. The class will utilize RStudio and Github.  

Each week students will be expected to attend two classes, on Tuesdays tools and methods will be covered, on Thursdays students will workshop their projects.

## Assessment

Each student will work on their own feature engineering project that tackles a self-defined problem. However, HUDK 5053 is largely a course about workflow and therefore students will be assessed on the accomplishment of the following workflow milestones, rather than the success or failure of their project:

 * Problem Design Statement
 * Data Submission
 * Exploratory Visualization
 * Methodological Description
 * Logic Model
 * Presentation
 * Final Deliverable

In addition to these milestones students will also monitor and record their project's progress and will be required to give to two progress statements, one verbally and one written.

**Grade Breakdown:**

 * Workflow Milestones - 60%
 * Progress Statements - 30%
 * Participation -       10%
